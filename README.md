# *AI Research Intelligence System (ARIS)*

> Your personal AI research assistant that never sleeps.

---

## *Overview*

The *AI Research Intelligence System (ARIS)* is a fully autonomous, end-to-end AI-powered research discovery and analysis engine.
It continuously scans global research databases, analyzes new publications using large language models, predicts their impact, and delivers insights directly to Notion, Slack, Gmail, and WhatsApp — all without manual input.

## *Key Features*

### *1. Autonomous Daily Operation*

* Executes automatically every morning.
* Fetches the latest research papers from ArXiv in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
* Requires zero human intervention once configured.

---

### *2. Multi-Source Data Fusion*

* Combines data from multiple trusted sources:

  * ArXiv (for new publications)
  * Semantic Scholar (for citation data)
  * Google Gemini (for abstract analysis and summarization)
* Creates a three-tier intelligence model:

  1. *Discovery* – What’s new
  2. *Understanding* – What it means
  3. *Impact* – Why it matters

---

### *3. Real-Time AI Analysis*

* Each paper is analyzed by Gemini, generating:

  * A three-point summary (method, results, significance)
  * A key insight statement
  * Automatic categorization (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision)
  * An impact score (1–10 scale)
* Converts raw research into structured, machine-readable intelligence.

---

### *4. Citation and Influence Tracking*

* Uses Semantic Scholar’s Graph API to fetch real-time citation data.
* Evaluates the paper’s influence and academic reach.
* Merges quantitative metrics with qualitative AI insights.

---

### *5. Intelligent Data Processing Pipeline*

* Normalizes and merges data using automated code nodes.
* Includes built-in rate-limit handling and JSON validation.
* Supports author frequency detection and trending topic discovery.

---

### *6. Notion Research Archive*

* Automatically populates a Notion database with:

  * Title, authors, and summary
  * Key insights
  * Impact score and citation count
  * Category and publication date
  * Direct ArXiv links
* Converts Notion into a living, searchable research library.

---

### *7. Smart Notifications*

*Slack Alerts*

* Posts real-time updates for high-impact papers directly into Slack channels.
* Keeps research teams instantly informed of breakthroughs.

*Gmail Digest*

* Sends a daily HTML digest containing:

  * Total papers analyzed
  * Top categories and authors

---

### *8. Research Insights and Trends*

* Aggregates papers daily to detect emerging trends such as:

  * Surges in specific research areas
  * Most-cited authors
  * Average impact scores
* Produces a statistical summary that visualizes the evolving landscape of AI research.

---

### *9. Executive-Level Reporting*

* Generates well-designed HTML reports featuring:

  * Modern responsive layout
  * Trend analytics
  * Clean typography and color-coded categories
* Ideal for research teams, newsletters, or institutional reporting.

---

### *10. Modular API-Based Architecture*

* Built on a fully API-driven system integrating:

  * ArXiv
  * Google Gemini
  * Semantic Scholar
  * Notion
  * Slack
  * Gmail
  * Twilio
* Supports easy extension to additional services such as OpenAI, Mistral, or social media integrations.
